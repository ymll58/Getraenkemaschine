# Automated Beverage Preparation Machine

This project involves the development of an automated beverage preparation machine, controlled by a microcontroller and various sensors. Users can select their preferred beverages through an Android app, which provides options like beverage type and size. The machine performs basic preparation tasks, controlled by a program written in C++. Communication between the app and the machine is facilitated via the MQTT platform (HiveMQ), allowing commands and feedback to be exchanged.

## Features

- **Automated Beverage Preparation**: The machine performs various beverage preparation tasks, including mixing, and dispensing.
- **Microcontroller Control**: The system is controlled by a microcontroller, which integrates with sensors to manage the preparation process.
- **Android App Interface**: Users can select beverages and customize options like type and size directly from the app.
- **MQTT Communication**: The machine and app communicate using the HiveMQ MQTT platform, ensuring real-time command and feedback exchange.
- **C++ Programming**: The machine's hardware is controlled through a C++ program, managing the preparation tasks efficiently.

## Technologies

- **Microcontroller**: The hardware is controlled by a microcontroller, which interfaces with sensors to automate the preparation process.
- **Android App**: Developed for user interaction, allowing beverage selection and customization.
- **MQTT (HiveMQ)**: For communication between the Android app and the beverage machine.
